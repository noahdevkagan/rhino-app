# Decisions

Append-only log of non-obvious choices: what was decided and the why that
would otherwise be lost. Newest last. Never rewrite old entries — if a
decision is reversed, append a new entry saying so and why.

Read this before re-litigating anything.

---

**2026-08-10 — Fork OpenSuperWhisper, don't rebuild.** 467 commits of
working hotkey/audio/text-insertion/engine code (MIT-licensed). The work
is stripping remote paths, grafting process, rebranding — not rewriting
solved problems.

**2026-08-10 — This is a product to distribute, not a personal tool.**
Own brand (Toucan), own site, signed/notarized DMG, full release
pipeline. Cribbed from MeetingCoach's pipeline in Phase 3.

**2026-08-10 — HARD CONSTRAINT: private, all-local.** Nothing goes to any
cloud; open-source on-device models only. This is the differentiator vs.
Wispr Flow ("your voice never leaves your Mac"). Only acceptable network
calls: Sparkle updates to our own appcast, explicit user-initiated model
downloads. Remote ASR and remote LLM cleanup get deleted (code paths, not
just UI) in Phase 1, and a hygiene gate makes the promise regression-proof.

**2026-08-10 — Private mirror, not a GitHub fork.** GitHub can't make a
fork of a public repo private, so `noahdevkagan/toucan-app` is a fresh
private repo holding the full upstream history, with upstream kept as a
git remote (`upstream`) for future pulls.

**2026-08-10 — Gate scripts live in `Scripts/` (capital S), not
`scripts/`.** Upstream already has `Scripts/`; macOS's case-insensitive
filesystem would silently merge the two while git records both paths.
Hooks path is `Scripts/githooks`.

**2026-08-10 — No Dependabot.** Config deleted, its 8 auto-PRs closed.
Submodule/SwiftPM auto-bumps are risky here (run.sh patches FluidAudio
source; whisper.cpp/llama.cpp bumps need real testing). Deps get bumped
deliberately, gated by the push gate.

**2026-08-10 — Phase 1: Remote ASR engine and remote LLM cleanup deleted
(code paths, not hidden UI).** 7 app files + 9 test files removed, plus
all prefs/UI plumbing. Stale `selectedEngine == "remote"/"groq"` migrates
to "whisper"; stored `aiBackend == "remote"` migrates to "builtin"; the
three remote API keys are scrubbed from the Keychain on launch (no code
can use them anymore). `usedLocalFallback` stays as a DB column and an
always-false flag so old history rows keep decoding.

**2026-08-10 — UpdateChecker deleted (the second update path).** Upstream
had Sparkle AND an unauthenticated GitHub-releases poll that pinged
api.github.com with the user's IP when Settings opened. Sparkle to our own
appcast is the ONE sanctioned update channel; the Updates tab is now
Sparkle-only and the release-notes feed will live on the Toucan site.

**2026-08-10 — Ollama cleanup endpoint is loopback-pinned in code.** The
endpoint field is free text, so `OllamaBackend` refuses any host that
isn't localhost/127.0.0.1/::1 — no DNS resolution (could change under
us), no LAN ranges (another machine is still another machine).

**2026-08-10 — ATS re-enabled.** `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` existed solely
for the remote engine; replaced with `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` only.
Sparkle + model downloads are HTTPS and pass full ATS.

**2026-08-10 — tests/hygiene is the privacy regression gate.** Static:
forbidden endpoint strings, resurrected remote files, ATS exemption.
Dynamic: a real CLI transcription in an isolated $HOME with `lsof`
sampling — any non-loopback socket fails the gate. The detector itself is
negative-tested (a synthetic remote lsof row must trip it). Fix the code,
never the gate.
